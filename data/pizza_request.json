My mom drew short straws and is working on this Sunday/holiday, and my dad doesn't live with us anymore.  The house is almost bare and my mom won't be back until late evening, so I was wondering if there were any redditors out there willing to help my brothers and I out with a pizza for lunch/dinner to give this drab Sunday of ours a defining, yummy meal.  Thanks for reading! and have a great father's day all."
